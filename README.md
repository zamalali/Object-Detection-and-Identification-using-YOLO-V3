# Object-Detection-and-Identification-using-YOLO-V3
Using yolo v3 which works on convolutional neural network detecting objects in real time.
Download COCO.names file along with yolo v3 cfg file
Please download yolo weight tiny file too from here "https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights"
You can then use the .py file and run without making any changes to the code.
Hope this helps :)
